# Compost-pH-monitoring-IoT
In the context of waste management and compost production, there is a need to address certain aspects. Currently, up to 5 tons of waste can be collected daily, but only 2 tons of waste can be processed each day, and this occurs at Telkom University. Additionally, the process of manually checking the pH level during compost production, aiming for an ideal pH of 7, has proven to be uncomfortable and impractical. Instead, they are considering the implementation of an IoT-based pH monitoring system to eliminate the need for purchasing pH meter paper and streamline the pH monitoring process.
